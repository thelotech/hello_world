# Lo Tech's Journey into InfoSec
Going from **ZERO** experience in the technical fields, I will be spending the next year attempting to jump into the world of InfoSec! I'll be collecting helpful bits of knowledge to assist in my endeavors!

## 1. Tools & Knowledge
Here are a list of tools and technical background I think I'll be needing (in no particular order):
* Linux
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

## 2. Resources
I'll be adding a bunch of links to resources that will help me along the way.
* [Infosec_Reference](https://github.com/rmusser01/Infosec_Reference/blob/master/Sphinx/README.md)
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [How to Build a Successful Cybersecurity Career](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/)
* [Zero to Hero, Practical Network Pentesting course](https://www.thecybermentor.com/zero-to-hero-pentesting)


## 3. Short-Term Goals
There are a lot of things I feel like I want to accomplish, and here are a few things I'll be working toward in the short-term:
* Setting up an at-home lab?
* Figure out how to make my [blog](https://thelotech.github.io) easier to manage: Currently, I'm just using HTML/CSS on each .html, which means if I change one CSS or the HTML coding, I have to make the change on EVERY .html.
* Figure out how to make my content appear correctly. I want it text, then a break, then the image, then a break, then more text.
....  [WRONG](wrongcode.png "The wrong coding way") & [RIGHT](rightcode.png "The correct coding way")
* Learn how to include coding language in blog posts so I can show the code instead of a screen shot of the code.

## 4. Success Stories
As I accomplish the goals listed above, I'll throw down the links to my journey in showing how I did it!
